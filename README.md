# 🧠 Machine Learning Classification Web App

A complete **Machine Learning + Flask Web Application** that predicts outcomes based on user input.  
The project trains multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM), compares their accuracies, and automatically selects the **best-performing model** for deployment.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Train & compare 3 ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Automatically selects the best model based on accuracy
- Saves the model as `model.pkl`
- Flask backend for prediction requests
- HTML user interface
- Fully reproducible workflow
